The following illustration shows the planned structure of the decomposition of [webgl-operate](https://webgl-operate.org/). For now we continue to use haeley-**webgl** and might switch to haeley-**webgpu** later:

## halb3

*halb3* is an open 2.5D visualization platform currently developed by the [Visual Analytics Research Group (varg)](https://varg.dev/). The term `halb3` is a german expression typically used to denote a time of day, nameley 2:30 am/pm. It is used in this context, to denote our two-and-a-half-dimensions we use for our visualization platform. 

## haeley
*haeley* denotes the rendering framework&mdash;previously [webgl-operate](https://webgl-operate.org/)&mdash;used for halb3. The name is composed of the names Paul **Hae**berli and Kurt Ake**ley**, the authors of [*'The accumulation buffer: hardware support for high-quality rendering'*](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/97879.97913), which describes the core idea of progressive rendering (basis for rendering the visualizations of halb3 in real-time).
